--analytical functions compute an aggregate value based on a group of rows.
--thet differ from aggregate functions in that they return multiple rows for each group.
--the group of rows is called a window and is defined by the analytic clause

--4 analytic families
--Ranking family: RANK, DENSE_RANK, PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST, NTILE
--Window aggregate family: the feature provides moving and cumulative processing for all SQL aggregate function
including AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX COUNT, VARIANCE
--Reporting aggregate family: the comparison of a non-aggregate value to an aggregate value, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, 
COUNT, VARIANCE, STDDEV
--LAG/LEAD family: enable queries to compare different rows of a table simply by specifying an offset from the
current row.


--Example 1) combine non-aggregated data and aggregated data
--before analytical functions
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, sales_amount,avg_samount
FROM sales,(SELECT AVG(sales_amount) AS avg_samount FROM sales); 

--applying the analytical function 
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, sales_amount,
AVG(sales_amount) OVER () AS avg_samount --avg sales_amount for the entire table
FROM sales;

--applying the analytical function based on specific window instead of the whole table
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, sales_amount,
AVG(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY sales_date) AS sales_amount
FROM sales;

--Example 2) aggregates are displayed for different groups of data
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, sales_amount,
AVG(sales_amount) OVER () AS avg_sales,
AVG(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY sales_date) AS avg_sales_day,
AVG(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY TRUN(sales_date,'mon')) AS avg_sales_month
FROM sales
ORDER BY 1;

--Example 3) obtain the cumulative sales total, row by row for all sales
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, sales_amount, 
SUM(sales_amount) OVER (order by sales_date, order_id, product_id) AS cum_sum
FROM sales;

--Example 4) show the sales as a percentage of total sales by using RATIO_TO_REPORT 
SELECT TRUNC(sales_date,'mon') AS sales_month,
SUM (total_amount) AS total_amount,
ROUND(RATIO_TO_REPORT (SUM (total_amount)) OVER () * 100,2) AS ratio_perc
FROM sales s
GROUP BYSELECT TRUNC(sales_date,'mon'); 

--Example 5) Rank function produces an ordered ranking of rows starting with a rank of one
SELECT TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon') AS sales_month, sp.fitst_name, SUM(s.total_amount)
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon') ORDER BY SUM(s.total_amount) DESC) AS salesperson_rank_top
FROM sales s, salesperson sp
WHERE s.slaesperson_id = sp.salesperson_id
GROUP BY TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon'),sp.fitst_name;

--Example 6) top N analysis: showing the top 3 salesperson per month
--if asking for the bottom 3 then delete the DESC
SELECT * FROM 
(
SELECT TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon') AS sales_month, sp.fitst_name, SUM(s.total_amount)
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon') ORDER BY SUM(s.total_amount) DESC) AS salesperson_rank_top
FROM sales s, salesperson sp
WHERE s.slaesperson_id = sp.salesperson_id
GROUP BY TRUNC(s.sales_date,'mon'),sp.fitst_name
)
WHERE salesperson_rank_top <= 3

--Example 7) NTILE function, devide a list of values in a partition into a specific number of groups called bands or buckets

SELECT sp.first_name, SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_amount,
NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.total_amount) DESC) AS bucket_list
FROM sales s, salesperson sp
WHERE s.salesperson_id=sp.salesperson_id
GROUP BY sp.first_name;
