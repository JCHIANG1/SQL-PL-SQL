--DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFFERED
--DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
--If a constraint is created with the DEFERRABLE keyword it can act in one of two ways (INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, INITIALLY DEFERRED). 
--The default, INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, keyword causes constraint validation to happen immediate unless deferred is specifically requested. 
--The INITIALLY DEFERRED keyword causes constraint validation to defer until commit, unless immediate is secifically requested.

--the advantage to use DERERRABLE option is that we can use IMMEDIATE/DEFERRED interchangablely
