7. DISABLE and ENABLE CONSTRAINTS
--add CASCADE after DISABLE CONSTRAINT to disable all constraints that depend on the specified constraint.
ALTER TABLE emp2 
DISABLE CONSTRAINT emp2_pk;

ALTER TABLE emp2
ENABLE CONSTRAINT emp2_pk;

ALTER TABLE emp2
DISABLE CONSTRAINT emp2_pk CASCADE;

--with new data: apply a constraint to new data only by specifying ENABLE NOVALIDATE
--The default is ENABLE VALIDATE, which means existing rows must pass the constraint check.
ALTER TABLE order
ENABLE NOVALIDATE CONSTRAINT order_status_uq;

8. rename the constraint name
ALTER TABLE emp2
RENAME CONSTRAINT emp2_pk TO new_emp2_pk;

9. Deferring a constraint
--a deferred constraint is one that is enforced when a transaction is committed,
--we use the DEFERREABLE clause when we initially add the constraint
--once the constraint is added, we cannot change it to DEFERRABLE, instead we need to drop and re-create the constraint.

--DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFFERED vs. DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
--If a constraint is created with the DEFERRABLE keyword it can act in one of two ways (INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, INITIALLY DEFERRED). 
--The default, INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, the constraint is checked whenever we add, update or delete rows from table.
--The INITIALLY DEFERRED keyword causes constraint validation to defer until commit.

--the advantage to use DERERRABLE option is that we can use IMMEDIATE/DEFERRED interchangablely

CREATE TABLE emp_sal
(
emp_id NUMBER,
sal NUMBER,
bonus NUMBER,
CONSTRAINT sal_ck CHECK(sal>100),
CONSTRAINT bouns_ck CHECK(bonus>0)
)
 --any DML not meet the constraint the error will immediately display
 INSERT INTO emp_sal(emp_id,sal,bonus)
 VALUES(1,90,5);

--drop constraints and re-create them 
ALTER TABLE emp_sal
DROP CONSTRAINT sal_ck;

ALTER TABLE emp_sal
DROP CONSTRAINT bouns_ck;

--ADD CONSTRAINT WITH DEFERRABLE option
ALTER TABLE emp_sal
ADD CONSTRAINT sal_ck CHECK(sal>100) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED; 
INSERT INTO emp_sal(emp_id,sal,bonus)
VALUES(1,90,5); -- it will be violated when commit

ALTER TABLE emp_sal
ADD CONSTRAINT bouns_ck CHECK(bonus>0) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE;
INSERT INTO emp_sal(emp_id,sal,bonus)
VALUES(1,200,-1); -- the violation will arise immediately
SET CONSTRAINT sal_ck IMMEDIATE;
