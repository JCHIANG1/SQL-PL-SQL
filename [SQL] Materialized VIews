--a materialized view is a table segment whose contents are periodically regreshed based on a query, 
--either against a local or remote table
--advantage: a) replication of data between sites
--b) improve performance: data can be summarized, pre computed and stored so that we can access the summarized data
--for reporting purposes

--Materialized views options
--the BUILD clause options are shown below
--IMMEDIATE: the materialized view is populated immediately, the data is stored
--DEFFERED: the materialized view is populated first when requested then refresh, the data is stored in the view when refresh

-- refresh type available:
--FAST: while the data is refreshing it updates the change to the view, its advantage is that it's fast but
--the materialized view log is required, without the log presented against the source table in advance, the creation fail.
--COMPLETE: the table segment supporting the materialized view is truncated and repopulated completely using the associated query.
--FORCE: a FAST refresh is attempted, if one is not possible a complete refresh is performed.

--a refresh can be triggered in one of two ways:
--ON COMMIT: the refresh is triggered by a committed data change in one of the dependent table
--ON DEMAND: the refresh is initiated by a manual request or a scheduled task
